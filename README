Automated setup for Service Map nodes
=====================================
This repository contains Ansible-scripts for automatically setting up nodes
for Hel Service Map. A Vagrantfile is included for testing in local virtual
machines.

Current version sets up replication between two PostgreSQL-instances,
one serving as master and other as a standby. Testing has only been done on
Ubuntu.

Directory /deployment contains the actual ansible scripts (playbook).
Notable files:
production:	ansible inventory, needs to be customized for the used hosts
vars.yml:	configuration for the scripts, currently IPs defined in
		inventory need to be set here as well

Additionally SSH access (preferably passwordless) and sudo functionality
for the user with SSH access must be available.

The playbook can be run with:
ansible-playbook -i production -u {remote_username}
